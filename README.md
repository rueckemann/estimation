Agile Estimation with team support

The idea of this app is to have a planning poker interface for a whole team. All the apps of one team connect to each other through W-Lan. As soon as everyone has selected one of the cards to estimate the current story the estimation result is presented on every screen. If the estimation is out of range the team members with the highest and lowest value are notified so that the can explain to the rest of the team why they estimated that high/low.
